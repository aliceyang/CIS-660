CIS 660 HW 4

====== VERSIONS USED ======
Houdini 13.0.314
Visual Studio 2008


========== NOTES ==========
-Environment paths have been set per TA request on canvas
-Finished implementing all required functionality
-Use grammar files included in /plants
-Because of the suggestion in the code to use GU_PrimPoly, I took that to mean actual cylinders were not required as long as the branch geometry was displayed (the homework writeup did not explicitly mention cylinders either). Thus the branches are displayed using a GU_POLY_OPEN with 2 endpoints. 
-See: _ss1.PNG, _ss2.PNG, _ss3.PNG

Thanks!
