Homework 2: L-Systems

====== VERSIONS USED ======
Maya 2012
Visual Studio 2010

===== L-SYSTEM COMMAND ====
An L-System will be generated after setting the grammar file via the browse 
command and selecting the iteration, step size, and angle values.

*Extra Credit*: I filtered the file browser to only pick up txt files. Also, the
selected grammar is displayed on the scrollField for clarity.

===== L-SYSTEM NODE =======
Selecting "Create L-System Node" creates an L system that can be manipulated
through its time, angle, size and grammar attributes. Note that when selecting
a grammar file, the plug-in automaticall prepends its own path name to the input
value, so paths should be relative. In this case, grammar files should follow the
following format: plants/simple1.txt

=========== NOTES ==========
Please see included screen shots of the programs for further clarification:
